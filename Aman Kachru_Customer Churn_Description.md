In this project i have made an model to analyse whether a particular customer will churn from the company or is he/she likely to churn with the help of some data analysis 
techinques and some machine learning models.
I have used 4 models in here and made my final model from the classifier with the best accuracy.
The models used are:
1. Decision Tree Classifier (DT)
2. Random Forest Classifer (RF)
3. Logistic Regression (LR)
4. K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN)

 The model i made is helpful in telling whether a new customer that has just arrived and availed some services will churn or not in the coming future.
 The model has been saved in a file called model.sav that can be used in some python program for making an app or a web site is one wishes for.
